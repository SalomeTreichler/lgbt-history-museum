        <h2>Founding of the first<br> homophilic organisation</h2>
        <p>
            The oldest, documented, homophilic organisation in america is the "Society for Human Rights". It was founded
            by Henry Gerber, one of the first gay activists in history.
            <br><br>

                    <p>The founder of this organization, Henry Gerber, is often referred to as the
                        “Grandfather of the American
                        Homophilic Movement. ” Gerber signed the founding documents as secretary of the organization,
                        while John
                        T. Graves, an African-American preacher, became president of the organization.
                        <br><br>
                        It was difficult for the SHR to find new members because a lot of men did not want to support
                        the organisation as it might tain their reputation. The publications of their newsletter
                        “Friendship and Freedom”, also had problems finding popularity, since at the time, magazines
                        about homosexuals where known as “thief magazines”.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the difficulties of finding new members, Gerber formulated a three-point strategy to
                        expand the organization and to convince authorities that there was a need for change.

                                We would engage in a series of lectures pointing out the attitude of society in
                                relation
                                to their own behavior and especially urging against the seduction of adolescents

                        <li>
                            <p>Through a publication named Friendship and Freedom we would keep the
                                homophile world in touch with the progress of our efforts, The publication was to
                                refrain from advocating sexual acts and would serve as a forum of discussion</p>

                            <p>Through self-discipline, homophiles would win the confidence and
                                assistance of legal authorities and legislators in understanding the problem: that these
                                authorities should be educated on the futility and folly of long prison terms for those
                                committing homosexual acts, etc</p>

                        SHR only accepted homosexual men, but its vice president, Al Weininger, was actually bisexual
                        and married with two children. His wife called the organisation “degenerate” and reported it to
                        a social worker, who passed the information on to the police.
                        <br><br>
                        The courtcase that followed cost Gerber all of his savings. And so, as the organization had lost
                        its financial support, Gerbers dream of the Society of Human Rights had ended.
