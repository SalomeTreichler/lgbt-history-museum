        <h2>Publishing of the <br> Kinsey Reports</h2>
        <p>
            The Kinsey Reports are two publications, written by Alfred Charles Kinsey. Many people were shocked because
            of the data presented of homosexual men and women living in america. According to the Kinsey Reports at
            least 30% of people are bisexual.

                        important historical events,
                        that made it impossible for Americans to continue to overlook the existence of homosexuals.</p>

                        According to the Kinsey Reports, about half of the population is bisexual to some extent.
                        Kinsey’s research found that 50% of men who remain single until the age of 35 had homosexual
                        experiences. Furthermore, 30% of all men had random homosexual experiences or reactions for at
                        least three years between the ages of 16 and 55.<br><br>
                        Based on these findings, the “Kinsey Scale” was created. The Kinsey Scale is a scale from 0
                        to 6, which shows a person’s sexual orientation. In addition, an “X” indicates that the person
                        has “no sociosexual contacts or reactions”.

                    <p>The publication of “Sexual Behavior in the Human Male” was the source of a huge uproar among
                        scientists, psychologists, clerics, moralists and, of course, the general public. Prior to
                        publication, it was assumed that homosexuality is a rare disease or is caused by the impairment
                        of the masculinity or immaturity contrary to heterosexuality. But the report showed that
                        same-sex attractions are part of our normal lives.</p>
