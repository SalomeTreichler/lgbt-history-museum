        <h2>Marsha P. Johnson Life and Death</h2>
        <p>
            Marsha P. Johnson was an activist for trans and gay rights and an icon to the community. Unfortunately, she
            died in 1992, when her corpse was found in the Hudson River. Although officially declared as a suicide, many
            people believe it was a murder.

                    <p>Born in New Jersey as Malcolm Michaels, she officially changed her name to Marsha P. Johnson in
                        1966, when she moved to Greenwich Village at the same time. Marsha was always a cheerful and
                        helpful person, the P in her name stood for “Pay it no Mind”, which was a rhetorical answer to
                        the question of whether she was male or female.
                        <br><br>
                        Marsha was known for wearing exotic clothes and jewelry. When she wore those clothes, she was
                        Marsha P. Johnson, but there were times when she switched back to her masculine persona Malcolm.

                <p>During the Stonewall riots, Marsha was in the middle of the battle, screaming and stone-throwing. In
                    David Carter’s book, “Stonewall”, many of the people interviewed claimed that Marsha was the person
                    who really started the uprising. Even Sylvia Rivera, when asked about Stonewall, says “This was
                    started by
                    the street queens of that era, which I was part of, Marsha P. Johnson, and many others that are not
                    here.”<br><br>

                        On July 6, 1992, Marca’s body was found in the Hudson River in New York. Police and
                        investigators called her death a suicide, but many of the people who knew her personally and
                        were very close to her, claim that Marsha was not suicidal. Eyewitnesses saw Marsha being
                        harassed earlier the same day and demanded a closer investigation of her death, assuming it was
                        murder.
                        <br><br>
                        However, there has been no criminal investigation of her death to this day.
