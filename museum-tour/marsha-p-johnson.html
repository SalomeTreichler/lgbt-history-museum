    <h2>Stonewall Riots</h2>
    <p>
        The Stonewall Riots were a series of riots centered around the Mafia owned bar, the "Stonewall Inn". The gay
        community and the police collided in multiple confrontations, ultimately resulting in the first ever Pride
        Parade.

            <div class="text-container-no-bg">
                <p>The Stonewall Inn, a bar in New York City, was a popular meeting place for homosexual men and
                    women to express their sexuality in 1969. For many, it was the only place where they could meet
                    people who were just like them. For many, it was the only place where they didn’t have to hide
                    from other people and could just be themselves.<br><br>
                    Back then, it was forbidden to dance with the same sex in most bars, but in the Stonewall Inn
                    the
                    dance floor was open to all genders. And so the Stonewall Inn became the homosexual equivalent
                    of a
                    popular heterosexual hangout.</p>

                <p>
                    During the 1960s, the Mafia dominated gay bars in New York City. The Stonewall Inn was one of
                    those bars that paid the police weekly to avoid being raided. The Stonewall Inn had no problems
                    with their finances, every Friday and Saturday night earning about five or six thousand
                    dollars (in 2021 that's about 35 000 – 40 000 dollars), from which they used
                    1,200 dollars (in 2021 almost nine thousand dollars) to keep the police off their necks. The
                    rest of the money was used to build better lighting and cages for male dancers. Despite the
                    danger coming from the bar having only a single entrance, which also served as an exit, the bar
                    was particularly popular with young men.
                    <br><br>
                    On Tuesday, June 24, 1969, Inspector Pine and Detective Smythe began gathering evidence against
                    the Stonewall Inn. Pine and Smythe had raided many other bars before, and their first visit to
                    the Stonewall Inn went smoothly.

                <p>
                    They managed to gather some evidence that the Stonewall Inn was
                    posing as a “bottle club. ” A Bottle Club is a private, member-only facility, which made it
                    easier
                    to serve homosexuals without getting into legal problems.

                <h3>Pine's Plan</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Pine was well prepared for the second raid. He assembled a small team consisting of four men from
                    another district, two undercover police officers from a neighboring district, and Detective
                    Smythe.
                    <br><br>
                    His original plan was for four undercover cops to enter the bar. Two men and two women. These
                    would mix with the crowd and observe the business. After they had seen enough to be used as
                    eyewitnesses, they were asked to leave the bar, rejoin the rest of the group and demand entry
                    into the bar together. Once they were in the bar, they would request backup through a
                    transmitter to tackle the raid together.
                    <br><br>
                    Pine’s plan was to confiscate the liquor from the
                    bar and arrest the staff. In addition, they wanted to take one of the cross-dressers with them
                    as proof that the bar allowed this, still forbidden, form of expression.

    <h3>The Riot</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
            <div class="text-container-no-bg">
                <p>
                    It was about 1:20 am in the morning of June 28, 1969, when the police announced the raid by
                    loudly knocking at the entrance of the bar.
                    <br><br>
                    Once inside, the police instructed all of the patrions to lign up in a row to verify their
                    identities and
                    find possible lawbreakers. One of the policemen called the local police station to ask for
                    backup,
                    which arrived on foot, as well as with three other patrol cars.
                    <br><br>
                    The officers sorted the guests into smaller groups. Employees and cross-dressers were taken to
                    the back room to be arrested later. The other bargoers were moved to the front bar to examine
                    them and eventually release them. So far everything went according to plan and the police began
                    to confiscate the alcohol.
                    <br><br>
                    Visitors after visitors who could identify themselves were released. Since the bar had a lot of
                    visitors that night, many of them stayed in front of the bar to wait for their friends and see
                    what would happen next. Many of the passersbys, interested in the events, also stopped in front
                    of the bar. Many of them were gay as well, so they were just as worried about friends and the
                    Stonewall Inn. Tourists and other visitors also noticed the scene and stayed close out of
                    curiosity. Soon hundreds of people had gathered around the Stonewall Inn.
                    <br><br>
                    The surroundings around the bar quickly became an improvised theatre stage. One by one, the bar
                    visitors came out of the bar in front of a small audience. Some celebrated, made victorious
                    postures or bowed. Soon the audience began to applaud for the performances and slowly but surely
                    grew bigger and bigger.
                    <br><br>
                    In the meantime, inside the Stonewall Inn, Pine was met with resistance from the Cross-Dressers,
                    and so he abandoned his plan to arrest only one of them and ordered them all to be arrested
                    instead. When they were taken to a police van in front of the bar, the audience reacted with
                    laughter, admiration and, above all, growing anger. This anger only grew stronger, when it
                    became clear, that all cross-dressers should be arrested. Some of them cooperated with the
                    police, but others resisted.
                    <br><br>
                    The tension between the two groups grew more and more, and Pine soon noticed that the raid was
                    becoming problematic. The arrested cross-dressers couldn’t all fit into the police car and the
                    crowd in front of the bar was too big to keep under control with the few police officers. The
                    arrests of the cross-dressers and some lesbians went far from smoothly and after a particularly
                    brutal arrest of a lesbian in men’s clothes, the unavoidable finally happened:

                <p>The crowd became a mob and from this mob, an uprising started.

                    The police were insulted and the crowd started throwing all sorts of coins at them and their
                    police cars. The once peaceful protest became the beginning of a revolution. Soon the
                    coins were replaced by glass bottles and finally they started throwing bricks.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, the police had no choice but to withdraw, for the first time in the
                    history of endless clashes and dozens of raids before.
                    <br><br>
                    The only question was where should one retreat to? There were still some employees and
                    cross-dressers at the Stonewall Inn, which had to be transported as soon as the police car came
                    back from its first trip.

                    Pine realized there was no other place to barricade himself but the
                    bar itself. But this
                    action only made the mob in front of the door more agitated and they began throwing bricks at
                    the door and windows until finally about thirty policemen from adjacent districts came to the
                    rescue.
                    <br><br>
                    Although still outnumbered, the shock of the arrival of this support was enough to ease the
                    uproar somewhat. Nevertheless, it proved to be anything but easy to transport the remaining
                    convicts and confiscate the alcohol. Finally, even the “Tactical Patrol Force” or TPF, which are
                    specially trained for such uprisings, had to appear on the scene, but they also failed to
                    control the situation. This brought great shame to the TPF and the rest of the police officers
                    and the anger among them was great.
                    <br><br>
                    The street unrest continued until four o’clock in the morning and ended in a glorious victory
                    for New York’s gay scene.
